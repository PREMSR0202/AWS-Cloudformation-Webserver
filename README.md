# Highly Scalable & Load Balanced Web Server Using Cloud Formation Technique in AWS Infrastructure
  
The main objective of this project is to build a NGINX web server on AWS cloud, which is highly available among different regions, scalable and should balance the load given by the users. Cloud Formation Technique[CFT] is proposed techique in this project.

## CLOUD FORMATION TECHNIQUE

* [CLOUD FORMATION TECHNIQUE DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) 

* AWS CloudFormation gives you an easy way to model a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them throughout their lifecycles, by treating infrastructure as code. 

* A CloudFormation template describes your desired resources and their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack. 

* You can use a template to create, update, and delete an entire stack as a single unit, as often as you need to, instead of managing resources individually. You can manage and provision stacks across multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions.
